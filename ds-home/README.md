To allow file uploads, the following nginx annotations are required

```yaml
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 4G
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: |-
      server_tokens off;
      proxy_hide_header X-Powered-By;

      rewrite ^/.well-known/webfinger /public.php?service=webfinger last;
      rewrite ^/.well-known/host-meta /public.php?service=host-meta last;
      rewrite ^/.well-known/host-meta.json /public.php?service=host-meta-json;
      location = /.well-known/carddav {
        return 301 $scheme://$host/remote.php/dav;
      }
      location = /.well-known/caldav {
        return 301 $scheme://$host/remote.php/dav;
      }
      location = /robots.txt {
        allow all;
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
      }
      location ~ ^/(?:build|tests|config|lib|3rdparty|templates|data)/ {
        deny all;
      }
      location ~ ^/(?:autotest|occ|issue|indie|db_|console) {
        deny all;
      }
```


We run NextCloud behind an nginx proxy that terminates SSL.  In order for URLs to be generated by NextCould with the correct protocol, the environment variable `OVERWRITEPROTOCOL=https` is added:

```yaml
nextcloud.extraEnv:
    - name: OVERWRITEPROTOCOL
      value: https
```
